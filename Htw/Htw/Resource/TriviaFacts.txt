In space the skin on your feet peels off!
One million Earths can fit inside the Sun.
You become taller in Space.
The hottest planet is not the closest planet to the Sun!
You can cry in space but your tears don’t fall
In space metal sticks together
There is a volcano on Mars three times the size of Everest.
